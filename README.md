# HeathkitRaduino
Starting from Allard's code with Pavel's teaching, control a Heathkit SB- or HW- series using Raduino.   In addition it provides for emulation of the CAT frequency controllability of an FT-857d, such that the vacuum tube Heathkit can be "tuned"  (within one band) by WINLINK server or client software.
